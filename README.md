Functional Requirements

    Fetch Blog Data:
        Use the JSONPlaceholder API to fetch a list of blog posts.
        Display the blog titles and descriptions in a card format.

    Search Functionality:
        Provide a search bar to filter blog posts by title.
        The search should update dynamically as the user types (debouncing is optional but a plus).
Category Filter (Optional for bonus points):

    Add a dropdown to filter blogs by user ID (userId from the API).

Responsive Design:

    Ensure the layout adapts to different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).
